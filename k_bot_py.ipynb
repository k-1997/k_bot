        "*   The project successfully installed the necessary libraries, including `streamlit`, `langchain`, `pypdf`, `python-docx`, `langchain-community`, and `langchain-openai`.\n",
        "*   A basic Streamlit UI was created with file upload functionality for PDF and DOCX files, a question input field, and a button to trigger processing.\n",
        "*   The code includes logic to load uploaded documents, save them temporarily, and process their content into text chunks.\n",
        "*   A knowledge base is successfully created from the document chunks using OpenAI embeddings and a Chroma vector store.\n",
        "*   A question-answering chain (`RetrievalQA`) is set up using a `ChatOpenAI` model and the created knowledge base retriever.\n",
        "*   The application integrates the QA chain with the UI to display bot responses to user questions.\n",
        "*   Chat history is maintained and displayed in the UI using `st.session_state` and `st.chat_message`.\n",
        "*   A `requirements.txt` file listing the project dependencies was successfully created.\n",
        "*   Step-by-step instructions were provided for connecting the project to a GitHub repository and deploying it on Streamlit Sharing, including guidance on handling API keys as secrets.\n",

        "*   Implement error handling and user feedback for document processing and API key configuration to improve the user experience.\n",
        "*   Explore more advanced retrieval techniques or language models to potentially enhance the accuracy and relevance of the chatbot's answers.\n"
